# MachineLearning
All my analysis on machine learning algorithms as i go along.

This repository will basically be housing the octave interpretations of all machine learning algorithms (from linear to non-linear) .
Bear in mind this is a work in progress and codes will be added as and when I learn the algorithms and their intuitions .

All datasets can be found here at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php
